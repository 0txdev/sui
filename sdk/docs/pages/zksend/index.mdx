# zkSend SDK

:::warning

The zkSend SDK is experimental, and may change before a stable version is released. The features
described in these docs are only available using the preview version of zkSend, at
https://preview.zksend.com.

:::

The zkSend SDK provides tools for interacting with the [zkSend website](https://zksend.com). It
allows dApps to integrate zkSend into their applications by providing a standard wallet interface.
It also provides functionality to create your own zkSend Claim Links, with support for any publicly
transferrable asset.
