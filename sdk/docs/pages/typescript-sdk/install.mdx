# Install Sui TypeScript SDK

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout type="note">
I had created my own tabs because I didn't know about npm2yarn. Thanks for the TIL, Michael! Would be nice to have similar behavior for everything (Windows/Mac, for example). And each persisted in local storage. I used `group` param for that. Codeblocked it all so as not to junk up the works.
</Callout>

```sh
import { Tab, Tabs } from '../../components'
```

The Sui TypeScript SDK is available in the monorepo and NPM.

## Install from NPM

To use the Sui TypeScript SDK in your project, run the following command in your project root:

```sh
<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]} group="pkg-mgr">
    <Tab>
```js
npm install --save @mysten/sui.js
```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
```js
yarn add @mysten/sui.js
```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
```js
pnpm i @mysten/sui.js
```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

## Experimental tag for use with a local Sui network 

Projects developing against one of the on-chain Sui networks (Devnet, Testnet, Mainnet) should use the base SDK published in the NPM registry (previous section) because the code aligns with the relevant JSON-RPC. If your developing against a [local network](https://docs.sui.io/testnet/build/sui-local-network) built from the `main` branch of the Sui monorepo, however, you should use the `experimental`-tagged SDK package as it contains the latest features (or a local build detailed in the section that follows).

```sh
<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]} group="pkg-mgr">
    <Tab>
```js
npm install --save @mysten/sui.js@experimental
```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
```js
yarn add @mysten/sui.js@experimental
```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
```js
pnpm i @mysten/sui.js@experimental
```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

## Install from local build

To build the SDK from the [Sui monorepo](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui), you must use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). With pnpm installed, run the following command from the `sui` root directory:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install
# Run the build for the TypeScript SDK
pnpm sdk build
```

With the SDK built, you can import the library from your `sui` project. To do so, use a path to the `sui/sdk/typescript` directory that is relative to your project. For example, if you created a folder `my-sui-project` at the same level as `sui`, use the following to import the locally built Sui Typescript package:

```bash
pnpm add ../sui/sdk/typescript
```
