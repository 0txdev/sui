# Hello Sui

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';



This basic example introduces you to the Sui TypeScript SDK. The Node.js example mints SUI on Testnet and then queries the address to get a sum for the owned SUI. You don't need to use an IDE to complete the example, but one like Microsoft Visual Studio Code helps centralize more advanced projects. 

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to follow this example, so install them on your system if you haven't already. 

## Before you begin

You need an address on a Sui development network (Devnet, Testnet, Localnet). If you don't already have an address, use the [Sui Client CLI](https://docs.sui.io/build/cli-client) or the [Sui Wallet browser extension](https://docs.mystenlabs.com/wallet) to create one. 

## Clone Sui project and build SDK

For the purpose of this topic, clone the [`sui` repo](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui) in a directory that makes sense for you. If you already have `sui` cloned, make sure to get latest from the `main` branch. 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git
```

If you plan to contribute to Sui, you should fork the sui repo and clone your fork to your system. For more information, see the [Contribute topic](https://docs.sui.io/contribute). 

For this example, use a local build of the Sui TypeScript SDK. To do so, change your working directory to `sui/sdk`.

```sh
cd sui/sdk
```

Build the SDK:

```sh
pnpm build
```

## Start a project

Create a folder on the same level as the `sui` cloned project on your system (`hello-sui` in this example) and make it the working directory. 

```sh
mkdir hello-sui
cd hello-sui
```

When you use pnpm to install the necessary packages, the package manager downloads the modules to your `node_modules` folder and adds the references to your `package.json` file. If the folder or file do not already exist, pnpm creates them for you. For this example, just install the package you built earlier in this topic using the following command: 

```sh
# Change the path, if necessary 
pnpm add ../sui/sdk/typescript
```

Your `package.json` file now has a *dependencies* section with your local path as the value for `@mysten/sui.js`.

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@mysten/sui.js": "link:../sui/sdk/typescript"
}
```

## Get some SUI for your account

Instead of a 'Hello World' output to your console, this example introduces some SUI to your wallet address. You must be on Devnet, Testnet, or a local network to use a faucet for minting SUI. 

Create a new `index.js` file in the root of your project with the following code.  

```js
import { requestSuiFromFaucetV1 } from '@mysten/sui.js/faucet';

const FAUCET_HOST = 'https://faucet.devnet.sui.io';

await requestSuiFromFaucetV1({
  host: FAUCET_HOST,
  recipient: '0x98bd90a13940cb3f6269dd7b2dcc787240fe9edebfe33fa35d736b5a0fcf2181',
})
```

<Callout type="note">
WIP. Final code (not in doc) was not working before.
</Callout>

The code imports the `requestSuiFromFaucetV1` function from the SDK and calls it to mint SUI for the provided address. The code also imports `SuiClient` to create a new client on Devnet that it uses to query the address and output the amount of SUI the address owns after minting the new SUI. 

Both Testnet and Devnet faucets have a rate limit to prevent spamming the network with faucet requests, so running the script too often eventually causes a `FaucetRateLimitError`. If you receive this error, you must wait at least an hour before trying again or use a local network.

You can also use the [Sui Client CLI](https://docs.sui.io/build/cli-client) to perform client calls on a Sui network.
