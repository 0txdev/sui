# Sui Owned Object Pools Quick Start

:::warning

Sui Owned Object Pools (SuiOOP) is a beta library. Enhancements and changes are likely during
development.

:::

SuiOOP is a TypeScript library that provides a set of tools for managing multiple concurrent
transactions on the Sui network to help avoid object equivocation and locking.

## Installation

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i suioop
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add suioop
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add suioop
```

:::

## Usage

At a high level, this is how you implement the library:

```ts
// Initialize the ExecutorServiceHandler.
const eshandler = await ExecutorServiceHandler.initialize(
adminKeypair,
suiClient,
);

/// And then for each incoming request...
/// ...get the incoming transactionBlock
const myTransactionBlock;

/// and send it for execution
const promise = eshandler.execute(myTransactionBlock, suiClient, splitStrategy);
```

See [End-to-End Examples](/typescript/owned-object-pool/examples) for sample code you can run.
